::: note Abstract
Monica by Avalonia is the desktop implementation of the Monica password vault, focused on local-first password management and MDBX vault compatibility. This document follows a README-style structure and provides a feature overview, tech stack, architecture view, and development notes.
:::

Monica by Avalonia aims to carry Monica’s local-first and security-first direction onto desktop platforms, offering management for passwords, TOTP, private notes, bank cards, and identity documents, along with local encryption, import/export, backup, and MDBX vault compatibility.

---

## Project Positioning

Monica by Avalonia is a local-first password vault client for desktop users. Built on Avalonia’s cross-platform desktop UI together with .NET 10 and the MDBX local vault, it is designed to deliver a desktop password management experience that is both modern and extensible.

Core goals of the project:

- Provide local encrypted vault and TOTP management capabilities
- Support compatibility with KeePass `.kdbx` and Monica / MDBX data
- Support backup and restore through WebDAV and OneDrive
- Provide desktop integrations such as file pickers, clipboard access, system tray support, and global shortcuts

---

## What You Get

- Local password vault: manage accounts, passwords, URLs, custom fields, attachments, and categories
- TOTP management: store and generate dynamic verification codes
- Private notes: support plain text and Markdown preview
- Cards and identity documents: manage bank cards, identity data, and other sensitive information in one place
- Password generation: built-in random password generation and strength analysis
- Local encryption: master password initialization, unlock, change, and secure recovery settings
- Import and export: support Monica JSON, password CSV, TOTP CSV, Aegis JSON, and more
- Sync and backup: WebDAV / OneDrive backup and restore
- MDBX vault: create, inspect, and manage Monica MDBX-1 local databases

## Architecture Overview

::: tip Architecture Preview
The architecture of Monica by Avalonia can be understood as a “desktop password vault thought tree,” centered on:

- The UI layer for interaction and presentation
- The Core layer for business logic and cryptography
- The Data layer for vault storage and persistence
- The Platform layer for sync, platform integration, and MDBX adaptation
:::

::: details Architecture Notes
- `Monica.App`: Avalonia UI, windows, and desktop services
- `Monica.Core`: domain models, cryptography, TOTP, import/export, password generation
- `Monica.Data`: local database, vault storage, migrations, and MDBX backend repositories
- `Monica.Platform`: cross-platform adaptation layer including WebDAV, OneDrive, KeePass, and the MDBX bridge
- `MDBX Rust workspace`: vault core, cryptography, storage, FFI, and CLI support
- `OS integrations`: file pickers, clipboard, DPAPI, browser bridge
- `Remote backup`: WebDAV/OneDrive backup and restore channels
:::

::: warning
In this architecture, <mark>MDBX is not an ordinary database table</mark>. Commit, snapshot, and conflict metadata must be managed through dedicated APIs or an FFI facade.

## MDBX-1 Integration

Monica by Avalonia supports the MDBX-1 local-first vault. It is not an ordinary SQLite password table, but a local database format with version history, conflict handling, snapshot recovery, and security boundaries.

The Avalonia side currently includes two MDBX integration paths:

- `MdbxUniffiNativeBridge`: calls the UniFFI bridge through `mdbx_ffi.dll` to operate the MDBX vault directly inside the local process
- `MdbxCliVaultEngine`: falls back to the MDBX CLI when the native bridge is unavailable, mainly for development and validation

> MDBX clients must maintain commit, tombstone, snapshot, conflict, and device-head metadata through the storage / repo APIs provided by the library or through an explicit FFI facade. Do not modify the underlying files directly.

For more details, refer to the MDBX repository documentation.

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- .NET SDK 10.0+
- Windows desktop environment
- Rust toolchain if you want MDBX CLI fallback support

### Restore and Build

```powershell
cd "e:\projects\MonicaDocs\docs\03.生态\03.Windows\monica by avalonia"
dotnet restore Monica.slnx
dotnet build Monica.slnx
```

### Run the Desktop App

```powershell
dotnet run --project "src\Monica.App\Monica.App.csproj"
```

### Run Tests

```powershell
dotnet test Monica.slnx
```

### Publish Example

```powershell
dotnet publish "src\Monica.App\Monica.App.csproj" -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

---

## Current Status

- The project is in an early development stage (`0.1.0`) and mainly serves as the desktop architecture and MDBX integration baseline.
- Test foundations already cover app settings, core services, password management, TOTP, MDBX storage, and platform services.
- For real sensitive data, multiple backups are still strongly recommended. More screenshots and release notes are still needed before a formal release.

---

## Relationship to Monica / MDBX

- Monica: provides the product vision, local-first direction, and password management UX reference
- MDBX: provides the local-first vault format and long-term maintainable data structures
- Monica by Avalonia: merges both into a desktop implementation for Windows
